        <h1>Curriculum Vitae</h1>
        <p>
          Product design, user-centered design methods and agile software
          development. These are some of the keywords that describe my interests
          and know-how. I have a long work history in communication and
          user-centered design. As a generalist equipped with a futuristic and
          social mind, I shine in duties where I get to use my social skills and
          design talents in practice, such as in project management, product
          design and testing.
